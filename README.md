## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project follows a **two-tier client-server architecture**:

- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with **React.js** (SPA)
  - Handles UI rendering, routing, and local state with React hooks
  - Uses **Axios** to communicate with the backend API
  - Clean separation with a `services` layer for API calls

- **Backend:**  
  - Expected to be a **REST API** (Node.js/Express, Django, or any stack)
  - Manages data validation, business logic, and database storage
  - Provides endpoints like `/api/products` for CRUD operations

    
## 🔄 How it works

When a user performs an action (like adding or editing a product), the React app sends an HTTP request to the backend API. 
The API processes it, updates or retrieves data from the database, and returns JSON responses, which the frontend uses to update the UI.
